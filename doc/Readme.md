Documentations
==============

Here, you will find two kinds of documentation.

- The documentation, concerning the 'project'.
It means all the plans and actions needed to design, implement,
and bring the new service with its features to the production
where it can be use by the end users.

It means all the documentation for the BAU (Business As Usual).
In other words, the documentation for the operators, support, users ...
We call this phase: Run The Business.
